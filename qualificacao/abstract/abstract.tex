Pattern matching is a mechanism used in some programming languages as general 
tool to process data based on its structure and many text editors support regular 
expression search. Programmers frequently uses tools with support to pattern 
matching to try and understand some piece of software, i.e., to do a static analysis 
of code. In this work, we present a formalization for producing a parse tree 
when executing some arbitrary Parsing Expression Grammar, a typing (and subtyping) 
relation and a pattern matching algorithm over these parse trees and a tool that 
implements the formalization. The tool was originally designed as a way to assist 
an automatic judge in evaluating the structure of a code submitted by a student, 
in addition to evaluating the output produced by the code. We also present some 
case studies to evaluate the tool's capabilities.
