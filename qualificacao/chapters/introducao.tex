% Automatic code analysis tools are commonly used in educational settings to
% support the evaluation of programming assignments. While many existing tools
% focus on correctness or performance, they often overlook the importance of
% how students solve the given problems, particularly whether they follow the
% concepts and constructs introduced during the course. 
% In introductory programming courses, it is important not only to assess 
% whether a student's solution is correct, but also to ensure that the 
% student is applying the concepts and techniques taught in class. 
% Automatic code analysis can help detect when students rely on language 
% features or external solutions that bypass the intended learning objectives.
% To adress this need, we propose a multi-language code analysis tool based on 
% Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs), designed to detect the use of advanced 
% or unauthorized constructs in students' code submissions. This tool aims to 
% assist educators in enforcing pedagogical boundaries while maintaining 
% flexibility across different programming languages.
